Installation Requirements
============

1. Python3
2. Postgresql (ver 11+ or greater)
2. pip3
3. virtualenv

Make sure that the postgresql instance is up and running.

Open the command prompt or terminal and
create a new database with the following commands.

```sh
        psql
        create database eeazy_crm
```

Installation Steps

============

1. Create a virtual environment using the following commands

```sh
    
        virtualenv -p python3 eeazycrm
        source eeazycrm/bin/activate
```

2. Add github repository using the following command

```python
    
        cd eeazycrm
        git remote add origin https://github.com/jagjot2008/EeazyCRM
        git pull origin master
```

3. Now create the configuration file using the command

```sh
    cp config_vars.example config_vars.py
```

    Open the config_vars.py file and add the database connection 
    parameters in the PRODUCTION DATABASE SETTINGS (Default). 
    
    You can also setup the development and testing settings if you wish to.

4. Install the dependencies

```sh
       pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Create the following environment variables

```python
       EMAIL_USER = <your username>
       EMAIL_PASS = <your password>
```

   If you want to run flask in development or testing mode set
   the following environment variable in addition to the above.

```python
       FLASK_ENV = development, or
       FLASK_ENV = testing
```

6. Run the command

```sh
       python3 run.py
```

   This will run the installation wizard. Follow the instructions
   in the wizard and after finishing installation, stop the
   application and start again by running the command in step #6.

That's it folks. Your CRM is running.
